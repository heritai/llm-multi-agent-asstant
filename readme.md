# Multi-Agent Compliance Assistant

Welcome to the repository for the Multi-Agent Compliance Assistant â€” an AI-powered system designed to help startups and companies navigate complex data privacy and regulatory compliance, such as GDPR.

This project uses Large Language Models (LLMs) and LangGraph to create a collaborative multi-agent architecture that:

- Gathers detailed company information through interactive dialogue  
- Applies relevant regulatory requirements to assess compliance  
- Generates clear, actionable recommendations for companies  

## Current Status

The project is actively under development. Core agent code, integration with LangGraph, and regulatory knowledge modules will be published here soon.

Stay tuned for updates!
